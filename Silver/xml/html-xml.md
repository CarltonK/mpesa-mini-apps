# HTML (hypertext Markup Language) - Used to create web pages
# XML (xXtensible Markup Language) - Used to store and transport data

Differences
1. Purpose = HTML is for web content display while XML is for store/transport data
2. Tags = HTML is predefined and XML is customizable
3. Semantics = HTML is not case sensitive (<BODY> = <body>) but XML is (<BODY> != <body>)
4. Formatting = HTML can be forgiving (allows errors) but XML is strict
5. Storage of Data = HTML cannot be used to store data but XML is flexible
